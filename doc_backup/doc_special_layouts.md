{{site.data.alerts.note}} By "layout," I'm not referring to the layouts in \_layouts in the project files. I'm referring to special ways of presenting information on the same "page" layout. {{site.data.alerts.end}}

## FAQ layout

See {{site.data.urls.doc_faq.link}} for an example of the FAQ format, which follows an accordion, collapse/expand format. This code is from Bootstrap.

## Knowledgebase layout

See {{site.data.urls.doc_kb_layout.link}} for a possible layout for knowledge base articles. This layout looks for pages containing specific tags.

## Scroll layout

If you have a long JSON message you're documenting, see the {{site.data.urls.doc_scroll.link}}. This layout adds a side pane showing links to pointers in the left pane. 

## Shuffle layout

If you want a dynamic card layout that allows you to filter the cards, see {{site.data.urls.doc_shuffle.link}}. This uses the Shuffle JS library.
